# Microverse Learning Path

1. **Webpack Module Federation** - Host container, 2 remotes (Marketing, Auth), shared deps, lazy loading
2. **Project Setup** - Monorepo (Yarn/Nx), shared UI lib, folder structure best practices
3. **Dev Workflow** - Independent runs, unified dev, HMR in MFEs
4. **Deployment** - Independent deploys (Vercel/Netlify), dynamic remote loading, version management
5. **Inter-App Communication** - Shared state (events/Redux), URL navigation, auth handoff, coupling tradeoffs
6. **Pitfalls & Interviews** - MF limitations, static vs dynamic remotes, shared deps, real-world use cases
7. **Bonus** - Multi-framework (Angular/Vue), SSR challenges, security (auth, script injection)
